Menstruation and reproductive health continue to be stigmatized,
leading to a lack of education and resources for women, 
particularly in underserved areas. 
Women often struggle with menstrual tracking, education on reproductive health, 
and understanding their cycles, which can impact their overall health and wellness. 
Moreover, many women lack access to reliable medical advice and support during critical stages like pregnancy. 
Men play a crucial role in supporting their partners throughout these stages, 
yet they often feel disconnected due to a lack of resources.
Consequently, there is a pressing need for a robust solution that offers education, tracking,
and support for women and their partners regarding menstruation and reproductive health.
